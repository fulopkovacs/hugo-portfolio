# Portfolio theme for Hugo

## Using archetypes

### Generate new about page
To generate a new about page (`./content/about/_index.md`), run the following command:

```
hugo new --kind about about
```

### Create a new projects page:
The new project will be located at (`./content/projects/sample.md`).

```
hugo new --kind projects projects/sample
```

**Don't forget to copy your cover image to `./static/img/project-covers`!**
